Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty Images Sanctioned entities, like those linked to North Korean hacking groups and U.S.-designated terrorist organizations such as Lebanon's Hezbollah, continue to rely on cryptocurrency for fundraising, according to a new report from Chainalysis. The American blockchain analysis firm's \"2024 Crypto Crime Report\" found that $24.2 billion of illicit cryptocurrency was transferred in 2023, based on already identified illicit crypto wallets. Chainalysis retroactively updates its yearly crypto figures when new illicit wallets come to light. While last year's numbers currently represent a drop from the previous year, Chainalysis noted a much higher proportion of the funds were attributed to sanctioned or terrorist-linked recipients, accounting for about 61.5% of total illicit transaction volume in 2023. \"Actors subject to sanctions are often cut off from international traditional financial systems, and crypto can become an attempted alternative mechanism to store, send, and receive funds,\" Andrew Fierman, head of sanctions strategy at Chainalysis, told CNBC on Thursday. watch now VIDEO2:2802:28 Half of last year's crypto crime was related to sanctions on Russia: Chainalysis CEO Street Signs Asia Crypto to avert sanctions Entities like the crypto \"mixer\" Tornado Cash and Garantex took the lion's share of illicit funds in 2023. Tornado Cash was sanctioned in August 2022 for its role in laundering crypto stolen by the North Korean hacking organization Lazarus Group. Russian-based exchange Garantex was sanctioned in April 2022 for its affiliation with illicit actors, including ransomware groups. Crypto mixers are software that obscure the history and origin of digital assets sent through them. The amount of crypto transferred to sanctioned entities has climbed in recent years in tandem with a greater share of new trade restrictions specifying crypto wallets. In 2023, the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctions list imposed a total of 18 new sanctions on individuals and entities, including their associated crypto wallets. At least nine of the new sanctions were against individuals and entities across China and Latin America for their alleged role in fentanyl manufacturing and trafficking. Meanwhile, five of the sanctions targeted entities deemed to have violated sanctions on North Korea. watch now VIDEO5:1905:19 How Tornado Cash blacklist by U.S. Treasury affects wider crypto ecosystem Crypto World The top crypto recipient added to the sanctions list last year was Sinbad.io \u2014 a bitcoin mixer that was shut down in November of 2023 \u2014 which received $665.4 million in crypto from the Lazarus Group. Still, sanctions have shown the ability to slow the flow of crypto funds to their targets. Tornado Cash's monthly inflows dropped by as much as 93% immediately following its placement on the U.S. list, according to Chainalysis. Though the firm noted inflows slowly rebounded from that low in the following months. Of sanctioned countries, Iran was a major recipient of illicit funds, with 73.3% of inflows coming from international mainstream exchanges indicating the services might be used to subvert sanctions, Chainalysis said. Terrorist financing Illicit crypto volume identified by Chainalysis as terrorist financing accounted for a much smaller proportion than that of transactions to sanctioned entities in 2022. Chainalysis argued that, contrary to popular belief, cryptocurrency is not an effective tool for terrorism funding because blockchain allows funds to be traced at a level of detail not typically available in traditional finance. \"The transparent nature of cryptocurrency combined with blockchain analytics provides an invaluable forensic tool that empowers governments to identify, trace, and disrupt the flow of funds \u2013 something that isn't possible with other forms of value transfer, especially cash,\" said Chanalysis's Fierman. Despite these obstacles, terrorist organizations have continued to try to utilize cryptocurrencies for fundraising, deploying intricate networks of crypto exchanges and service providers, the report said. watch now VIDEO7:2907:29 TRM Labs' Ari Redbord explains the role of crypto in terror financing Squawk Box Last year, tracing efforts resulted in the seizure of millions in funds. In one such case, Israel's National Bureau for Counter Terror Financing said in June that it had seized $1.7 million of cryptocurrency linked to Hezbollah and Iran's Quds Force through a Syria-based financial facilitator named Tawfiq Muhammad Said Al-Law. Chainalysis's report outlined how Al-Law's relied on a network of legitimate mainstream exchanges and an extensive network of wallets for cryptocurrency transactions to aid Hezbollah's cryptocurrency financing infrastructure. The wallets linked to Al-Law collectively received funds ranging from millions to over $1 billion in cryptocurrency, involving up to tens of thousands of transfers. Meanwhile, entities and individuals linked to designated terrorist groups, such as ISIS and Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham, have continued to solicit cryptocurrency through crowdfunding efforts. watch now VIDEO9:5609:56 U.S. announces new sanctions against Hamas operatives using crypto: CNBC Crypto World Crypto World However, according to Fierman, efforts in tracing and seizing these funds have become increasingly sophisticated. \"The data also shows that as crypto adoption by illicit actors continues to grow, sanctioning bodies like OFAC are continually evolving their methods to identify these actors and disrupt their activities,\" he added. In another example cited in the Chainalysis report, Al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, announced their decision to stop accepting crypto donations last year due to the risk of potential donors being traced. This followed reports that Hamas had received large amounts of cryptocurrencies in the lead up to its attack on Israel on Oct. 7. Although terrorism financing is a \"small share\" of illicit crypto activity, it still presents an \"ever-present concern\" in the ecosystem, said Chainalysis in its report. Strengthened public and private partnerships are needed to help bolster these efforts and to decipher between illicit actors and funds sent to conflict zones for legitimate causes, it added.","Hashtags":null,"Article link":"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2024\/02\/29\/sanctioned-and-terrorist-entities-receive-most-global-illicit-crypto.html","Article Summary":"The American blockchain analysis firm's \"2024 Crypto Crime Report\" found that $24.2 billion of illicit cryptocurrency was transferred in 2023.

Christopher Furlong | Getty Images LONDON \u2014 A former British finance minister on Wednesday joined cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase as a global advisor, beefing up the company's regulatory bargaining power at a time when it faces severe scrutiny stateside. Coinbase announced that George Osborne, who served as Britain's chancellor of the exchequer from 2010 to 2016, will join the company on its global advisory council. He'll join the likes of Mark Esper, the former U.S. Secretary of Defense and Patrick Toomey (R-PA) on the council, which is in place to \"advise Coinbase on our global strategy as we grow our reach around the world.\" Faryar Shirzad, Coinbase's chief policy officer, said the company was \"pleased to have George join our council at an exciting time for us in the U.K. and globally.\" \"George brings with him a wealth of experience in business, journalism and government. We look forward to relying on his insights and experiences as we grow Coinbase around the world,\" Shirzard added. Osborne will serve in an advisory capacity at Coinbase, helping connect the company with politicians and regulators to help further the cause of forming crypto-friendly regulations. While chancellor of the exchequer, Osborne launched a slew of austerity policies aimed at reducing the budget deficit, including freezing child benefits, reducing housing benefits, and implementing a two-year pay freeze for public sector workers. He also tried to stimulate business activity by cutting corporation tax. watch now VIDEO3:5803:58 Price compression of bitcoin trading begins today, says Mizuho's Dan Dolev The Exchange Osborne was temporarily editor-in-chief at London's Evening Standard newspaper after completing his tenure as Britain's finance minister. He is currently a partner at Robey Warshaw LLP, a boutique investment bank. \"There's a huge amount of exciting innovation in finance right now,\" Osborne said. \"Blockchains are transforming financial markets and online transactions.\" \"Coinbase is at the frontier of these developments. I look forward to working with the team there as they build a new future in financial services,\" Osborne continued. Osborne's ties with Coinbase aren't new Suggestions of a growing relationship between Osborne and Coinbase first emerged last year, when Coinbase's CEO Brian Armstrong spoke onstage in a fireside moderated by Osborne at a fintech event in London. Osborne subsequently spoke with Coinbase's chief financial officer, Alesia Haas, at a fireside chat in the Belvedere Hotel during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. It comes as Coinbase has made something of a land grab across Europe, expanding in multiple countries over the last few months with new licenses in place. The company was granted a virtual asset service provider license in France last month, paving the way for expansion of its services there. It has also recently secured licenses in Spain, Singapore, and Bermuda. Coinbase is currently facing a harsh regulatory crackdown in the U.S. where the Securities and Exchange Commission has accused the company of violating securities laws. Coinbase denies the allegations. watch now VIDEO7:0807:08 Galaxy Digital's Michael Novogratz on bitcoin ETFs: An amazing product for consumers & institutions Squawk Box Last year, Coinbase chief Armstrong appeared on stage with Osborne at the Innovate Finance Global Summit conference in London.

Anything including, you know, relocating,\" Armstrong told Osborne. He told CNBC's Arjun Kharpal at the time that Coinbase was \"looking at other markets\" as it considers its position from a regulatory standpoint. Armstrong did later clarify in an interview with CNBC's Dan Murphy that Coinbase had no formal plans to relocate from its U.S. headquarters in San Francisco. \"Coinbase is not going to relocate overseas,\" Armstrong said. \"We're always going to have a U.S. presence ...

One of the concerns about the AI models \u2014 the kind that underpin applications like ChatGPT \u2014 is that the data they are trained on could contain biases or misinformation. That means the answers an AI system may give would contain those biases and false information. Blockchain hit the market in 2009 with the launch of the cryptocurrency bitcoin. In the context of bitcoin, the technology is an immutable and tamper-proof public ledger of transactions. Businesses have been looking to put these principles to use in other applications for blockchain, which is sometimes referred to as distributed ledger technology. In the case of AI, training data can be put on the blockchain. That will allow the developers of the AI system to keep track of the data that the model has been trained on. Casper Labs, a business-focused blockchain firm, partnered with IBM this month to create such a system. \"The product that we are developing, the datasets are actually checkpointed and stored on the blockchain so you have a proof of how the AI is trained,\" Medha Parlikar, chief technology officer and co-founder of Casper Labs, told CNBC during a panel discussion at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week. \"And so as you use the AI, if it's learning and you find that the AI is starting to hallucinate, you can actually roll back the AI. And so you can undo some of the learning and go back to a previous version of the AI.\" Hallucinations broadly refer to when an AI system gives out false information. Blockchain is a technology that has been spoken about for many years, and a host of industries ranging from finance to health care have been looking at ways to use it. Sheila Warren, the CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation, said, however, that a blockchain-based AI training data ledger could be the \"killer use case\" for the technology. \"I actually do think that the verification of an AI and sort of the checks and balances ... within an AI system, are going to be blockchain driven and blockchain backed,\" Warren told CNBC during the panel.","Hashtags":null,"Article link":"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2024\/01\/22\/blockchain-tech-behind-bitcoin-can-be-used-to-track-ai-training-data.html","Article Summary":"Blockchain could be used to keep a check on the data artificial intelligence models are being trained on to avoid issues like bias, executives told CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos.
